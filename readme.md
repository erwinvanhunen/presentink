## Text Typer / Auto Typing
There is preliminary support for auto typing based upon a script, which uses the same format as the ZoomIt script format. E.g. it supports tags like [up],[down],[left],[right],[enter] and [end]. Activate this functionality in the settings by turning on 'Experimental features'. Create a text file with your text, and separate the entries with [end].

```
This is the first line. I will have to press the shortcut again to show the next line[end]
I pressed the shortcut [pause:3] and I just paused 3 seconds[end]
[up]Now I went a line up and continue to type[end]
```
Select the text file from the Text Typer menu. Move the cursor to a program where you can type text (PresentInk does not check that, it will simply start to type after you pressed the shortcut), and press the shortcut Option+Shift+T (or the one you configured in the settings).

The text will cycle back to the first line after the last entry has been 'typed'.
